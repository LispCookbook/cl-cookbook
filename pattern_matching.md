title: Pattern Matching
---

The [ANSI Common Lisp
standard](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/index.html)
does not include facilities for pattern matching, but a couple of
libraries exist for those tasks: see
[Optima](https://github.com/m2ym/optima) or
[Trivia](https://github.com/guicho271828/trivia).

See also the respective [Cliki: pattern
matching](http://www.cliki.net/pattern%20matching) page for more
links.
