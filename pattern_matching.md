title: Pattern Matching & Regular Expressions
---

The
[ANSI Common Lisp standard](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/index.html)
does not include facilities for pattern matching and regular
expressions, but a couple of libraries exist for those tasks: see
[Optima](https://github.com/m2ym/optima) or
[Trivia](https://github.com/guicho271828/trivia) for pattern matching
and [cl-ppcre](http://weitz.de/cl-ppcre/) for regular expressions.

See also the respective
[Cliki: pattern matching](http://www.cliki.net/pattern%20matching) and
[Cliki: regexp](http://www.cliki.net/Regular%20Expression) pages for more links.

Note that some CL implementations include regexp facilities, notably
[CLISP](http://clisp.sourceforge.net/impnotes.html#regexp) and
[ALLEGRO CL](https://franz.com/support/documentation/current/doc/regexp.htm). If
in doubt, check your manual or ask your vendor.
