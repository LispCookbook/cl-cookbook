# Lisp Cookbook

This is a fork of the [Common Lisp Cookbook][sf], moved from SourceForge due to its awfulness.

This project will bring Common Lisp Cookbook to this decade. Development of the original Common Lisp Cookbook in SourceForge halted in 2007. In the meantime, a lot has happened in the land of Common Lisp. Tools and implementations have been improving, and some have fallen out of favor. Most notably, Common Lisp users can now benefit from [Quicklisp][ql] library manager.

The main goal is making the Cookbook more modern and more accessible in addition to updating and expanding the content. Cookbook is an invaluable resource, as it shows in very to the point manner how to do various things in clear fashion without all the theoretical mumbo jumbo. Sometimes you just need to look things up. While cookbooks can never replace proper documentation such as [HyperSpec][hs] or books such as [Practical Common Lisp][pcl], every language deserves a good cookbook, Common Lisp included.
