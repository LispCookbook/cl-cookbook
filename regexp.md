title: Regular Expressions
---

The [ANSI Common Lisp
standard](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/index.html)
does not include facilities for regular expressions, but a couple of
libraries exist for this task, for instance:
[cl-ppcre](https://github.com/edicl/cl-ppcre).

See also the respective [Cliki:
regexp](http://www.cliki.net/Regular%20Expression) page for more
links.

Note that some CL implementations include regexp facilities, notably
[CLISP](http://clisp.sourceforge.net/impnotes.html#regexp) and
[ALLEGRO
CL](https://franz.com/support/documentation/current/doc/regexp.htm). If
in doubt, check your manual or ask your vendor.

The description provided below is far from complete, so don't forget
to check the reference manual that comes along with the CL-PPCRE
library.

## PPCRE

[CL-PPCRE](https://github.com/edicl/cl-ppcre) (abbreviation for
Portable Perl-compatible regular expressions) is a portable regular
expression library for Common Lisp with a broad set of features and
good performance. It has been ported to a number of Common Lisp
implementations and can be easily installed (or added as a dependency)
via Quicklisp:

~~~lisp
(ql:quickload "cl-ppcre")
~~~

Basic operations with the CL-PPCRE library functions are described
below.


### Looking for matching patterns: scan, create-scanner

The `scan` function tries to match the given pattern and on success
returns four multiple-values values - the start of the match, the end
of the match, and two arrays denoting the beginnings and ends of
register matches. On failure returns `NIL`.

A regular expression pattern can be compiled with the `create-scanner`
function call. A "scanner" will be created that can be used by other
functions.

For example:

~~~lisp
(let ((ptrn (ppcre:create-scanner "(a)*b")))
  (ppcre:scan ptrn "xaaabd"))
~~~

will yield the same results as:

~~~lisp
(ppcre:scan "(a)*b" "xaaabd")
~~~

but will require less time for repeated `scan` calls as parsing the
expression and compiling it is done only once.


### Extracting information

CL-PPCRE provides several ways to extract matching fragments.

#### all-matches, all-matches-as-strings

The function `all-matches-as-strings` is very handy: it returns a list of matches:

~~~lisp
(ppcre:all-matches-as-strings "\\d+" "numbers: 1 10 42")
;; => ("1" "10" "42")
~~~

The function `all-matches` is similar, but it returns a list of positions:

~~~lisp
(ppcre:all-matches "\\d+" "numbers: 1 10 42")
;; => (9 10 11 13 14 16)
~~~

Look carefully: it actually return a list containing the start and end
positions of all matches: 9 and 10 are the start and end for the first
number (1), and so on.

If you wanted to extract integers from this example string, simply map
`parse-integer` to the result:

~~~lisp
CL-USER> (ppcre:all-matches-as-strings "\\d+" "numbers: 1 10 42")
;; ("1" "10" "42")
CL-USER> (mapcar #'parse-integer *)
(1 10 42)
~~~

The two functions accept the usual `:start` and `:end` key arguments. Additionnaly, `all-matches-as-strings` accepts a `:sharedp` argument:

> If SHAREDP is true, the substrings may share structure with TARGET-STRING.

#### scan-to-strings, register-groups-bind

The `scan-to-strings` function is similar to `scan` but returns
substrings of target-string instead of positions. This function
returns two values on success: the whole match as a string plus an
array of substrings (or NILs) corresponding to the matched registers.

The `register-groups-bind` function tries to match the given pattern
against the target string and binds matching fragments with the given
variables.

~~~lisp
(ppcre:register-groups-bind (first second third fourth)
      ("((a)|(b)|(c))+" "abababc" :sharedp t)
    (list first second third fourth))
;; => ("c" "a" "b" "c")
~~~

CL-PPCRE also provides a shortcut for calling a function before
assigning the matching fragment to the variable:

~~~lisp
(ppcre:register-groups-bind
  (fname lname (#'parse-integer date month year))
      ("(\\w+)\\s+(\\w+)\\s+(\\d{1,2})\\.(\\d{1,2})\\.(\\d{4})"
       "Frank Zappa 21.12.1940")
    (list fname lname date month year))
;; => ("Frank" "Zappa" 21 12 1940)
~~~

### Replacing text: regex-replace, regex-replace-all

~~~lisp
(ppcre:regex-replace "a" "abc" "A") ;; => "Abc"
;; or
(let ((pat (ppcre:create-scanner "a")))
  (ppcre:regex-replace pat "abc" "A"))
~~~


### Syntactic sugar

You might like to use CL-PPCRE with the
[**cl-interpol**](https://edicl.github.io/cl-interpol/#regular)
library. cl-interpol is a library for Common Lisp which modifies the
reader in a way that introduces interpolation within strings similar
to Perl, Scala, or Unix Shell scripts.

In addition to loading the CL-INTERPOL library, initialization call
must be made to properly configure the Lisp reader. This is
accomplished by either calling the `enable-interpol-syntax` function
from the REPL or placing that call in the source file before using any
of its features:

~~~lisp
(interpol:enable-interpol-syntax)
~~~

In this mode you can write regular expressions in-between `#?/` and `/`.
