  <a name="#redir"><h3>Redirecting the Standard Output of your Program</h3></a>

  You do it like this:

<pre>
(let ((*standard-output* <em>&lt;some form generating a stream&gt;</em>))
  <em>...</em>)
</pre>

   Because <a href="http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/reference/HyperSpec/Body/v_debug_.htm">*STANDARD-OUTPUT*</a> is a dynamic variable, all references to
   it during execution of the body of the LET form refer to the stream
   that you bound it to.  After exiting the LET form, the old value of
   *STANDARD-OUTPUT* is restored, no matter if the exit was by normal
   execution, a RETURN-FROM leaving the whole function, an exception,
   or what-have-you.  (This is, incidentally, why global variables
   lose much of their brokenness in Common Lisp compared to other
   languages: since they can be bound for the execution of a specific
   form without the risk of losing their former value after the form
   has finished, their use is quite safe; they act much like
   additional parameters that are passed to every function.)
<br>&nbsp;<br>
   If the output of the program should go to a file, you can do the
   following:

<pre>
(with-open-file (*standard-output* "somefile.dat" :direction :output
                                   :if-exists :supersede)
  <em>...</em>)
</pre>
  
   <a
  href="http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/reference/HyperSpec/Body/m_w_open.htm">WITH-OPEN-FILE</a> opens the file - creating it if necessary - binds
  *STANDARD-OUTPUT*, executes its body, closes the file, and restores
  *STANDARD-OUTPUT* to its former value.  It doesn't get more
   comfortable than this!
