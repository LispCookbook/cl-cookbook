<p>By <cite>threads</cite>, I mean separate execution strands within a
single Lisp process. For information about communication with other
<cite>processes</cite>, see <a href="os.html">Interfacing with your
OS</a>.</p>

<p>The ANSI Common Lisp standard doesn't mention this topic. So almost
everything that can be said here depends on your OS and your
implementation.</p>

<p>Speaking of implementations, the following discussion currently
refers only to <a href="http://www.xanalys.com/">Xanalys</a> <a
href="http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/products/">LispWorks</a>.
It has been tested on LispWorks for Windows version 4.2.6 running on
Windows NT (SP 6). Your mileage may vary. I will add "support" for
other implementations and operating systems to this page later, if I
have the time and access to the appropriate materials.</p>
