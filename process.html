<p>By <cite>threads</cite>, I mean separate execution strands within a
single Lisp process. For information about communication with other
<cite>processes</cite>, see <a href="os.html">Interfacing with your
OS</a>.</p>

<p>The ANSI Common Lisp standard doesn't mention this topic. So almost
everything that can be said here depends on your OS and your
implementation.</p>

<p>Speaking of implementations, the following discussion currently
refers only to <a href="http://www.xanalys.com/">Xanalys</a> <a
href="http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/products/">LispWorks</a>.
It has been tested on LispWorks for Windows version 4.2.6 running on
Windows NT (SP 6). Your mileage may vary. I will add "support" for
other implementations and operating systems to this page later, if I
have the time and access to the appropriate materials.</p>

<a name="why_bother"></a>
<h3>Why bother?</h3>

<p>The first question to resolve is: why bother with threads?
Sometimes your answer will simply be that your application is so
straightforward that you need not concern youself with threads at
all. But in many other cases it's difficult to imagine how a
sophisticated application can be written without multi-threading. For
example:</p>

<ul>

<li>you might be writing a server which needs to be able to respond to
more than one user / connection at a time;</li>

<li>you might want to perform some background activity, without
halting the main application while this is going on;</li>

<li>you might want to keep the application running while waiting for
some system resource to become available;</li>

<li>you might need to interface with some other system which requires
multithreading (for example, "windows" under Windows generally run in
their own threads);</li>

<li>you might want to associate different contexts (e.g. different
dynamic bindings) with different parts of the application;</li>

<li>you might even have the simple need to do two things at once.</li>

</ul>

<a name="basics"></a>
<h3>Basics</h3>

<p>In order to run a function in a separate thread, you need to do two
things.</p>

<ol>

<li>Make sure that multithreading is running. By default,
multithreading is always running in the LispWorks for Windows
environment so in this case there is nothing to do. See
<a href="#initializing">initializing multithreading</a> below to find
out how to get threads running on other platforms.</li>

<li>Now call your function, in its new thread. For example:

<pre>
(defvar *foo* 0)
(defun foo () (incf *foo*))
(mp:process-run-function "Incrementing *foo*" nil 'foo)
*foo*  => 1
</pre>

</li>
</ol>

<p>In the above example, you created a new thread called
<code>"Incrementing *foo*"</code>. The function <code>foo</code> was
invoked (with no arguments) in that thread. When <code>foo</code>
returned, the thread no longer had any work to do and so was
terminated.</p>

<p>Note the following:</p>

<ul>

<li>The first argument to <code>mp:process-run-function</code> is a
string naming the thread. You don't have to make the names unique, but
it's a smart move if you do in actual code, as it's a great way to
tell your threads apart when you're debugging them. When playing
around in the listener, you'll often find no harm in using an empty
string here.</li>

<li>The second argument to <code>mp:process-run-function</code> is a
list of <cite>process initialization keywords</cite>. You'll almost
always leave this empty (so you needn't bother about any details).</li>

<li>The third argument is the function to invoke in the new
thread. This should be a function designator, for example, an <code>fboundp</code>
symbol or a <code>lambda</code> form. </li>

<li>Any remaining arguments to <code>mp:process-run-function</code>
are passed to your function. So calls to
<code>mp:process-run-function</code> look like calls to
<code>funcall</code> with two additional arguments at the
beginning.</li>

<li>A call to <code>mp:process-run-function</code> returns immediately
(the return value is of type <code>mp:process</code>), while the new
thread executes asynchronously.</li>

</ul>

<p>Another simple example:</p>

<pre>

CL-USER 15 &gt; (mp:process-run-function "sleep in the background" nil 'sleep 10)
#&lt;MP:PROCESS Name "sleep in the background" Priority 850000 State "Running"&gt;

CL-USER 16 &gt; (mp:find-process-from-name "sleep in the background")
#&lt;MP:PROCESS Name "sleep in the background" Priority 0 State "Sleeping on mailbox"&gt;

CL-USER 17 &gt; (sleep 10)       ;; At this point the listener sleeps for ten seconds
NIL

CL-USER 18 &gt; (mp:find-process-from-name "sleep in the background")
NIL                           ;; The background process has finished its job and terminated

CL-USER 19 &gt;

</pre>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> get two or three new threads running
simultaneously, and convince yourself they're all there.</p>


<a name="output"></a>
<h3>Where's my output?</h3>

<p>An obvious way to test whether threads are behaving as you imagine
they ought, is to get them to print messages to the listener. For
example, you might feel justified in trying something like:</p>

<pre>

CL-USER 23 &gt; (mp:process-run-function "test" () (lambda () (print 99)))
#&lt;MP:PROCESS Name "test" Priority 850000 State "Running"&gt;

CL-USER 24 &gt; ;; Where's my output?

</pre>

<p>Where indeed is your output? The answer is that your new thread has
a different <code>*standard-output*</code> to the listener, and that's
where your output has gone to. Here is how you might find out where
precisely that is:

<pre>

CL-USER 1 &gt; (mp:process-run-function ""() (lambda () (print *standard-output* #.*standard-output*)))
#&lt;MP:PROCESS Name "" Priority 850000 State "Running"&gt;

#&lt;Synonym stream to *TERMINAL-IO*&gt;
CL-USER 2 &gt;

</pre>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Open the console
(i.e. <code>*terminal-io*</code>) by evaluating <code>(read-char
*terminal-io*)</code>; type a <code>#\Newline</code> into the console
to return to <code>read-char</code>. Now you can prove directly where
a thread's output goes.</p>
