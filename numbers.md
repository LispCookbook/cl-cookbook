## Introduction

### Integer types

Common Lisp provides a true integer type, called `bignum`, limited only by the total
memory available (not the machine word size). For example this would
overflow a 64 bit integer by some way:

~~~lisp
* (expt 2 200)
1606938044258990275541962092341162602522202993782792835301376
~~~

For efficiency, integers can be limited to a fixed number of bits,
called a `fixnum` type. The range of integers which can be represented
is given by:

~~~lisp
* most-positive-fixnum
4611686018427387903
* most-negative-fixnum
-4611686018427387904
~~~

Functions which operate on or evaluate to integers include:

* [`isqrt`][isqrt], which returns the greatest integer less than or equal to the
  exact positive square root of natural.

~~~lisp
* (isqrt 10)
3
* (isqrt 4)
2
~~~

* [`gcd`][gcd] to find the Greatest Common Denominator
* [`lcm`][lcm] for the Least Common Multiple.

Like other low-level programming languages, Common Lisp provides literal
representation for hexadecimals and other radixes up to 36. For example:

~~~lisp
* #xFF
255
* #2r1010
10
* #4r33
15
* #8r11
9
* #16rFF
255
* #36rz
35
~~~

### Rational types

Rational numbers of type [`ratio`][ratio] consist of two `bignum`s, the
numerator and denominator. Both can therefore be arbitrarily large:

~~~lisp
* (/ (1+ (expt 2 100)) (expt 2 100))
1267650600228229401496703205377/1267650600228229401496703205376
~~~

It is a subtype of the [`rational`][rational] class, along with
[`integer`][integer].

### Floating point types

See [Common Lisp the Language, 2nd Edition, section 2.1.3][book-cl-2.1.3].

Floating point types attempt to represent the continuous real numbers
using a finite number of bits. This means that many real numbers
cannot be represented, but are approximated. This can lead to some nasty
surprises, particularly when converting between base-10 and the base-2
internal representation. If you are working with floating point
numbers, then reading [What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About
Floating-Point Arithmetic][article-floating-point-arithmetic] is highly
recommended.

The Common Lisp standard allows for several floating point types. In
order of increasing precision these are: `short-float`,
`single-float`, `double-float`, and `long-float`. Their precisions are
implementation dependent, and it is possible for an implementation to
have only one floating point precision for all types.

The constants [`short-float-epsilon`, `single-float-epsilon`,
`double-float-epsilon` and `long-float-epsilon`][float-constants] give
a measure of the precision of the floating point types, and are
implementation dependent.

ECL specifically bases its `long-float` on C's `long double`, and thus has
higher precision:

```
CL-USER> (lisp-implementation-type)
"ECL"
CL-USER> most-positive-single-float
3.4028235e38
CL-USER> most-positive-double-float
1.7976931348623157d308
CL-USER> most-positive-long-float
1.189731495357231765l4932
```

#### Floating point literals

When reading floating point numbers, the default type is set by the special
variable [`*read-default-float-format*`][read-default-float-format]. By default
this is `SINGLE-FLOAT`, so if you want to ensure that a number is read as double
precision then put a `d0` suffix at the end

~~~lisp
* (type-of 1.24)
SINGLE-FLOAT

* (type-of 1.24d0)
DOUBLE-FLOAT
~~~

Other suffixes are `s` (short), `f` (single float), `d` (double
float), `l` (long float) and `e` (default; usually single float).

The default type can be changed, but note that this may break packages
which assume `single-float` type.

~~~lisp
* (setq *read-default-float-format* 'double-float)
* (type-of 1.24)
DOUBLE-FLOAT
~~~

Note that unlike in some languages, appending a single decimal point
to the end of a number does not make it a float:

~~~lisp
* (type-of 10.)
(INTEGER 0 4611686018427387903)

* (type-of 10.0)
SINGLE-FLOAT
~~~

#### Floating point errors

If the result of a floating point calculation is too large then a floating
point overflow occurs. By default in [SBCL][SBCL] (and other implementations)
this results in an error condition:

~~~lisp
* (exp 1000)
; Evaluation aborted on #<FLOATING-POINT-OVERFLOW {10041720B3}>.
~~~

The error can be caught and handled, or this behaviour can be
changed, to return `+infinity`. In SBCL this is:

~~~lisp
* (sb-int:set-floating-point-modes :traps '(:INVALID :DIVIDE-BY-ZERO))

* (exp 1000)
#.SB-EXT:SINGLE-FLOAT-POSITIVE-INFINITY

* (/ 1 (exp 1000))
0.0
~~~

The calculation now silently continues, without an error condition.

A similar functionality to disable floating overflow errors
exists in [CCL][CCL]:

~~~lisp
* (set-fpu-mode :overflow nil)
~~~

In SBCL the floating point modes can be inspected:

~~~lisp
* (sb-int:get-floating-point-modes)
(:TRAPS (:OVERFLOW :INVALID :DIVIDE-BY-ZERO) :ROUNDING-MODE :NEAREST
 :CURRENT-EXCEPTIONS NIL :ACCRUED-EXCEPTIONS NIL :FAST-MODE NIL)
~~~

#### Arbitrary precision

For arbitrary high precision calculations there is the
[computable-reals][computable-reals] library on QuickLisp:

~~~lisp
* (ql:quickload :computable-reals)
* (use-package :computable-reals)

* (sqrt-r 2)
+1.41421356237309504880...

* (sin-r (/r +pi-r+ 2))
+1.00000000000000000000...
~~~

The precision to print is set by `*PRINT-PREC*`, by default 20

~~~lisp
* (setq *PRINT-PREC* 50)
* (sqrt-r 2)
+1.41421356237309504880168872420969807856967187537695...
~~~

### Complex types

There are 5 types of complex number: The real and imaginary parts must
be of the same type, and can be rational, or one of the floating point
types (short, single, double or long).

Complex values can be created using the `#C` reader macro or the function
[`complex`][complex]. The reader macro does not allow the use of expressions
as real and imaginary parts:

~~~lisp
* #C(1 1)
#C(1 1)

* #C((+ 1 2) 5)
; Evaluation aborted on #<TYPE-ERROR expected-type: REAL datum: (+ 1 2)>.

* (complex (+ 1 2) 5)
#C(3 5)
~~~

If constructed with mixed types then the higher precision type will be used for both parts.

~~~lisp
* (type-of #C(1 1))
(COMPLEX (INTEGER 1 1))

* (type-of #C(1.0 1))
(COMPLEX (SINGLE-FLOAT 1.0 1.0))

* (type-of #C(1.0 1d0))
(COMPLEX (DOUBLE-FLOAT 1.0d0 1.0d0))
~~~

The real and imaginary parts of a complex number can be extracted using
[`realpart` and `imagpart`][realpart-and-imaginary]:

~~~lisp
* (realpart #C(7 9))
7
* (imagpart #C(4.2 9.5))
9.5
~~~

#### Complex arithmetic

Common Lisp's mathematical functions generally handle complex numbers,
and return complex numbers when this is the true result. For example:

~~~lisp
* (sqrt -1)
#C(0.0 1.0)

* (exp #C(0.0 0.5))
#C(0.87758255 0.47942555)

* (sin #C(1.0 1.0))
#C(1.2984576 0.63496387)
~~~

## Reading numbers from strings

The [`parse-integer`][parse-integer] function reads an integer from a string.

The [parse-float][parse-float] library provides a parser which cannot evaluate
arbitrary expressions, so should be safer to use on untrusted input:

~~~lisp
* (ql:quickload :parse-float)
* (use-package :parse-float)

* (parse-float "23.4e2" :type 'double-float)
2340.0d0
6
~~~

See the [strings section][strings] on converting between strings and numbers.

## Converting numbers

Most numerical functions automatically convert types as needed.
The `coerce` function converts objects from one type to another,
including numeric types.

See [Common Lisp the Language, 2nd Edition, section 12.6][book-cl-12.6].

### Convert float to rational

The [`rational` and `rationalize` functions][rational-and-rationalize] convert
a real numeric argument into a rational. `rational` assumes that floating
point arguments are exact; `rationalize` exploits the fact that floating point
numbers are only exact to their precision, so can often find a simpler
rational number.

### Convert rational to integer

If the result of a calculation is a rational number where the numerator
is a multiple of the denominator, then it is automatically converted
to an integer:

~~~lisp
* (type-of (* 1/2 4))
(INTEGER 0 4611686018427387903)
~~~

## Rounding floating-point and rational numbers

The [`ceiling`, `floor`, `round` and `truncate`][ceiling-functions] functions
convert floating point or rational numbers to integers.  The difference
between the result and the input is returned as the second value, so that the
input is the sum of the two outputs.

~~~lisp
* (ceiling 1.42)
2
-0.58000004

* (floor 1.42)
1
0.41999996

* (round 1.42)
1
0.41999996

* (truncate 1.42)
1
0.41999996
~~~

There is a difference between `floor` and `truncate` for negative
numbers:

~~~lisp
* (truncate -1.42)
-1
-0.41999996

* (floor -1.42)
-2
0.58000004

* (ceiling -1.42)
-1
-0.41999996
~~~

Similar functions `fceiling`, `ffloor`, `fround` and `ftruncate`
return the result as floating point, of the same type as their
argument:

~~~lisp
* (ftruncate 1.3)
1.0
0.29999995

* (type-of (ftruncate 1.3))
SINGLE-FLOAT

* (type-of (ftruncate 1.3d0))
DOUBLE-FLOAT
~~~

## Comparing numbers

See [Common Lisp the Language, 2nd Edition, Section 12.3][book-cl-12.3].

The `=` predicate returns `T` if all arguments are numerically equal.
Note that comparison of floating point numbers includes some margin
for error, due to the fact that they cannot represent all real
numbers and accumulate errors.

The constant [`single-float-epsilon`][single-float-epsilon] is the smallest
number which will cause an `=` comparison to fail, if it is added to 1.0:

~~~lisp
* (= (+ 1s0 5e-8) 1s0)
T
* (= (+ 1s0 6e-8) 1s0)
NIL
~~~

Note that this does not mean that a `single-float` is always precise
to within `6e-8`:

~~~lisp
* (= (+ 10s0 4e-7) 10s0)
T
* (= (+ 10s0 5e-7) 10s0)
NIL
~~~

Instead this means that `single-float` is precise to approximately
seven digits. If a sequence of calculations are performed, then error
can accumulate and a larger error margin may be needed. In this case
the absolute difference can be compared:

~~~lisp
* (< (abs (- (+ 10s0 5e-7)
             10s0))
     1s-6)
T
~~~

When comparing numbers with `=` mixed types are allowed. To test both
numerical value and type use `eql`:

~~~lisp
* (= 3 3.0)
T

* (eql 3 3.0)
NIL
~~~

## Operating on a series of numbers

Many Common Lisp functions operate on sequences, which can be either lists
or vectors (1D arrays). See the section on
[mapping][mapping].

Operations on multidimensional arrays are discussed in
[this section][arrays].

Libraries are available for defining and operating on lazy sequences,
including "infinite" sequences of numbers. For example

* [Clazy][clazy] which is on QuickLisp.
* [folio2][folio2] on QuickLisp. Includes an interface to the
* [Series][series] package for efficient sequences.
* [lazy-seq][lazy-seq].

## Working with Roman numerals

The `format` function can convert numbers to roman numerals with the
`~@r` directive:

~~~lisp
* (format nil "~@r" 42)
"XLII"
~~~

There is a [gist by tormaroe][gist-tormaroe] for reading roman numerals.

## Generating random numbers

The [`random`][random] function generates either integer or floating point
random numbers, depending on the type of its argument.

~~~lisp
* (random 10)
7

* (type-of (random 10))
(INTEGER 0 4611686018427387903)
* (type-of (random 10.0))
SINGLE-FLOAT
* (type-of (random 10d0))
DOUBLE-FLOAT
~~~

In SBCL a [Mersenne Twister][mersenne-twister] pseudo-random number generator
 is used. See section [7.13 of the SBCL manual][sbcl-7.13] for details.

The random seed is stored in [`*random-state*`][random-state] whose internal
representation is implementation dependent. The function
[`make-random-state`][make-random-state] can be used to make new random
states, or copy existing states.

To use the same set of random numbers multiple times,
`(make-random-state nil)` makes a copy of the current `*random-state*`:

~~~lisp
* (dotimes (i 3)
    (let ((*random-state* (make-random-state nil)))
      (format t "~a~%"
              (loop for i from 0 below 10 collecting (random 10)))))

(8 3 9 2 1 8 0 0 4 1)
(8 3 9 2 1 8 0 0 4 1)
(8 3 9 2 1 8 0 0 4 1)
~~~

This generates 10 random numbers in a loop, but each time the sequence
is the same because the `*random-state*` special variable is dynamically
bound to a copy of its state before the `let` form.

Other resources:

* The [random-state][random-state] package is available on QuickLisp, and
  provides a number of portable random number generators.

## Bit-wise Operation

Common Lisp also provides many functions to perform bit-wise arithmetic
operations. Some commonly used ones are listed below, together with their
C/C++ equivalence.

<style>
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
th, td {
  padding: 5px;
}
th {
  text-align: left;
}
</style>

      <td>Bit-wise right shift</td>
    </tr>
