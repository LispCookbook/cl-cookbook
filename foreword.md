<!-- that's for the EPUB and the PDF versions -->

The Common Lisp Cookbook is a collaborative resource. Thanks to
everyone who helped along the way.

<!-- We want the Cookbook to help you learn Common Lisp in a wide range of -->
<!-- day-to-day tasks. It can be used by Lisp newcomers as a tutorial -->
<!-- (getting started, functions, CLOS…) and by everybody as a reference -->
<!-- (loop!). -->

We hope that these EPUB and PDF versions make the learning experience
even more practical and enjoyable.
