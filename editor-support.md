title: Editor support
---

The editor of choice is still Emacs, but it is not the only one.

## Emacs

[SLIME](https://github.com/slime/slime/) is the Superior Lisp
Interaction Mode for Emacs. It has support for interacting with a
running Common Lisp process for compilation, debugging, documentation
lookup, and so on.

[Portacle](https://shinmera.github.io/portacle/) is a portable and
multiplatform Common Lisp environment. It ships Emacs25, SBCL,
Quicklisp, Slime and Git.

## Vim

[Slimv](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php) is a full-blown
environment for Common Lisp inside of Vim.

[Vlime](https://github.com/l04m33/vlime) is a Common Lisp dev
environment for Vim (and Neovim), similar to SLIME for Emacs and SLIMV
for Vim.

## Atom

See [Atom-Slime](https://atom.io/packages/atom-slime). This package
allows you to interactively develop Common Lisp code, helping turn
Atom into a full-featured Lisp IDE.
