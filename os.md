title: Interfacing with your OS
---


The ANSI Common Lisp standard doesn't mention this topic. (Keep in mind that it was written at a time where [Lisp Machines](http://kogs-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~moeller/symbolics-info/symbolics.html) were at their peak. On these boxes Lisp _was_ your operating system!) So almost everything that can be said here depends on your OS and your implementation.

## Accessing Environment variables

ASDF comes with a function that'll allow you to look at Unix/Linux environment variables on a lot of different CL implementations:

~~~lisp
* (uiop:getenv "HOME")
  "/home/edi"
~~~

Below is an example implementation:

~~~lisp
* (defun my-getenv (name &optional default)
  "Obtains the current value of the POSIX environment variable NAME."
  (declare (type (or string symbol) name))
  (let ((name (string name)))
    (or #+abcl (ext:getenv name)
        #+ccl (ccl:getenv name)
        #+clisp (ext:getenv name)
        #+cmu (unix:unix-getenv name) ; since CMUCL 20b
        #+ecl (si:getenv name)
        #+gcl (si:getenv name)
        #+mkcl (mkcl:getenv name)
        #+sbcl (sb-ext:posix-getenv name)
        default)))
MY-GETENV
* (my-getenv "HOME")
"/home/edi"
* (my-getenv "HOM")
NIL
* (my-getenv "HOM" "huh?")
"huh?"
~~~

You should also note that some of these implementations also provide the ability to _set_ these variables. These include ECL (`si:setenv`) and AllegroCL, LispWorks, and CLISP where you can use the functions from above together with [`setf`](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_setf_.htm). This feature might be important if you want to start subprocesses from your Lisp environment.

Also note that the
[Osicat](https://www.common-lisp.net/project/osicat/manual/osicat.html#Environment)
library has the method `(environment-variable "name")`, on POSIX-like
systems including Windows. It is also `fset`-able.

## Accessing the command line arguments

### Basics

Accessing command line arguments is implementation-specific but it
appears most implementations have a way of getting at
them. [Roswell](https://github.com/roswell/roswell/wiki) or external
libraries (see next section) make it portable.

[SBCL](http://www.sbcl.org) stores the arguments list in the special variable `sb-ext:*posix-argv*`

~~~lisp
$ sbcl my-command-line-arg
~~~

....

~~~lisp
* sb-ext:*posix-argv*

("sbcl" "my-command-line-arg")
*
~~~

More on using this to write standalone Lisp scripts can be found in the [SBCL Manual](http://www.sbcl.org/manual/index.html#Command_002dline-arguments)

[LispWorks](http://www.lispworks.com) has `system:*line-arguments-list*`

~~~lisp
CL-USER> system:*line-arguments-list*
("/Users/cbrown/Projects/lisptty/tty-lispworks" "-init" "/Users/cbrown/Desktop/lisp/lispworks-init.lisp")
~~~

[CMUCL](http://www.cons.org/cmucl/) has interesting extensions for [manipulating the arguments](http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/doc/cmu-user/unix.html)

Here's a quick function to return the argument strings list across multiple implementations:

~~~lisp
(defun my-command-line ()
  (or
   #+SBCL *posix-argv*
   #+LISPWORKS system:*line-arguments-list*
   #+CMU extensions:*command-line-words*
   nil))
~~~

Now it would be handy to access them in a portable way and to parse
them according to a schema definition.

### Parsing command line arguments

We have a look at the
[Awesome CL list#scripting](https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl#scripting)
section and we'll show how to use [unix-opts](https://github.com/mrkkrp/unix-opts).

~~~lisp
(ql:quickload "unix-opts")
~~~

We can now refer to it with its `opts` nickname.

We first declare our arguments with `opts:define-opts`, for example

~~~lisp
(opts:define-opts
    (:name :help
           :description "print this help text"
           :short #\h
           :long "help")
    (:name :level
           :description "The level of something (integer)."
           :short #\l
           :long "level"
           :arg-parser #'parse-integer))
~~~

Everything should be self-explanatory. Note that `#'parse-integer` is
a built-in CL function.

Now we can parse and get them with `opts:get-opts`, which returns two
values: the first is the list of valid options and the second the
remaining free arguments. We then must use multiple-value-bind to
catch everything:

~~~lisp
(multiple-value-bind (options free-args)
    ;; There is no error handling yet (specially for options not having their argument).
    (opts:get-opts)
~~~

We can explore this by giving a list of strings (as options) to
`get-opts`:


~~~lisp
(multiple-value-bind (options free-args)
                   (opts:get-opts '("hello" "-h" "-l" "1"))
                 (format t "Options: ~a~&" options)
                 (format t "free args: ~a~&" free-args))
Options: (HELP T LEVEL 1)
free args: (hello)
NIL
~~~

If we put an unknown option, we get into the debugger. We refer you to
unix-opts' documentation and code sample to deal with erroneous
options and other errors.

We can access the arguments stored in `options` with `getf` (it is a
property list), and we can exit (in a portable way) with
`opts:exit`. So, for example:

~~~lisp
(multiple-value-bind (options free-args)
    ;; No error handling.
    (opts:get-opts)

  (if (getf options :help)
      (progn
        (opts:describe
         :prefix "My app. Usage:"
         :args "[keywords]")
        (exit))) ;; <= exit takes an optional return status.
    ...
~~~

And that's it for now, you know the essential. See the documentation
for a complete example, and the Awesome CL list for useful packages to
use in the terminal (ansi colors, printing tables and progress bars,
interfaces to readline,â€¦).


<a name="fork-cmucl"></a>

## Forking with CMUCL

Here's a function by Martin Cracauer that'll allow you to compile a couple of files in parallel with [CMUCL](http://www.cons.org/cmucl/). It demonstrates how to use the UNIX [`fork`](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fork&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+4.5-RELEASE&format=html) system call with this CL implementation.

~~~lisp
(defparameter *sigchld* 0)

(defparameter *compile-files-debug* 2)

(defun sigchld-handler (p1 p2 p3)
  (when (> 0 *compile-files-debug*)
    (print (list "returned" p1 p2 p3))
    (force-output))
  (decf *sigchld*))

(defun compile-files (files &key (load nil))
  (setq *sigchld* 0)
  (system:enable-interrupt unix:sigchld #'sigchld-handler)
  (do ((f files (cdr f)))
      ((not f))
    (format t "~&process ~d diving for ~a" (unix:unix-getpid)
            `(compile-file ,(car f)))
    (force-output)
    (let ((pid (unix:unix-fork)))
      (if (/= 0 pid)
          ;; parent
          (incf *sigchld*)
          ;; child
          (progn
            (compile-file (car f) :verbose nil :print nil)
            (unix:unix-exit 0)))))
  (do () ((= 0 *sigchld*))
    (sleep 1)
    (when (> 0 *compile-files-debug*)
      (format t "~&process ~d still waiting for ~d childs"
              (unix:unix-getpid) *sigchld*)))
  (when (> 0 *compile-files-debug*)
    (format t "~&finished"))
  (when load
    (do ((f files (cdr f)))
        ((not f))
      (load (compile-file-pathname (car f))))))
