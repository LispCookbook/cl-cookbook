title: Setting up Emacs on Windows or Mac
---

Emacs is the preferred Lisp source code editor for most CL developers.

If you want to get going easily, get
[Portacle](https://shinmera.github.io/portacle/), a **portable** and
**multi-platform** CL development environment. You get:

- Emacs, slightly customized,
- Slime,
- SBCL,
- Quicklisp,
- Git.

You only need to download Portacle and double-click to run it.
