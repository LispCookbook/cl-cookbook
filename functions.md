## Functions that return functions

"How do I write a function that returns a function?" is a typical question asked by people who have learned Scheme before they started with Common Lisp. In Scheme, they were accustomed to be able to do things like this:

~~~lisp
==> (define (adder n) (lambda (x) (+ x n)))
adder

==> ((adder 3) 5)
8

==> (define (doubler f) (lambda (x) (f x x)))
doubler

==> ((doubler +) 4)
8
~~~

This can of course be done in Common Lisp, but the syntax and the semantics are different. The first step, creating a function that returns a function, looks very similar apart from minor syntactical conventions, but what happens behind the scenes is different:

~~~lisp
CL-USER> (defun adder (n) (lambda (x) (+ x n)))
ADDER
~~~

Here we have defined the function `adder` which returns an _object_ of _type_ [`function`](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/t_fn.htm). To create such an object you'll have to use the special operator [`function`](<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/s_fn.htm) and apply it to a _lambda expression_. `(function` _form_`)` may be abbreviated as `#'`_form_. In our example above we used a shorthand notation provided by the macro [`lambda`](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_lambda.htm). Without this little bit of syntactical sugar we would have to write it as

~~~lisp
CL-USER> (defun adder (n) #'(lambda (x) (+ x n)))
ADDER
~~~

or

~~~lisp
CL-USER> (defun adder (n) (function (lambda (x) (+ x n))))
ADDER
~~~

No matter how we write it, `adder` will now return a function whenever we call it. But we _can't_ use it in the same way we would use it in Scheme:

~~~lisp
CL-USER> (adder 3)
#<Interpreted Function "LAMBDA (N)" {485FFE81}>

CL-USER> ((adder 3) 5)
In: (ADDER 3) 5
    ((ADDER 3) 5)
Error: Illegal function call.
~~~

Here is why: CL has different _namespaces_ for functions and variables, i.e. the same _name_ can refer to different things depending on it's position in a form that's evaluated:

~~~lisp
CL-USER> (boundp 'foo)
NIL
CL-USER> (fboundp 'foo)
NIL
CL-USER> (defparameter foo 42)
FOO
* foo
42
CL-USER> (boundp 'foo)
T
CL-USER> (fboundp 'foo)
NIL
CL-USER> (defun foo (x) (* x x))
FOO
CL-USER> (fboundp 'foo)
T
* foo            ;;; ***
42
CL-USER> (foo 3)        ;;; +++
9
CL-USER> (foo foo)
1764
CL-USER> (function foo)
#<Interpreted Function FOO {48523CC1}>
* #'foo
#<Interpreted Function FOO {48523CC1}>
CL-USER> (let ((+ 3)) (+ + +))
6
~~~

To simplify a bit, you can think of each symbol in CL having (at least) two "cells" in which information is stored. One cell - sometimes referred to as its _value cell_ - can hold a value that is _bound_ to this symbol, and you can use [`boundp`](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_boundp.htm) to test whether the symbol is bound to a value (in the global environment). You can access the value cell of a symbol with [`symbol-value`](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_symb_5.htm).


The other cell - sometimes referred to as its _function cell_ - can hold the definition of the symbol's (global) function binding. In this case, the symbol is said to be _fbound_ to this definition. You can use [`fboundp`](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_fbound.htm) to test whether a symbol is fbound. You can access the function cell of a symbol (in the global environment) with [`symbol-function`](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_symb_1.htm).


Now, if a _symbol_ is evaluated, it is treated as a _variable_ in that it's value cell is returned - see the line marked with _***_ above. If a _compound form_, i.e. a _cons_, is evaluated and its _car_ is a symbol, then the function cell of this symbol is used - see the line marked _+++_ above.


In Common Lisp, as opposed to Scheme, it is _not_ possible that the car of the compound form to be evaluated is an arbitrary form. If it is not a symbol, it _must_ be a _lambda expression_, which looks like

`(lambda `_lambda-list_ _form*_`)`


This explains the error message we got above - `(adder 3)` is neither a symbol nor a lambda expression. But, you might ask, how _do_ we use the function object that is returned by `adder`? The answer is: Use [`funcall`](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_funcal.htm) or [`apply`](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_apply.htm):

~~~lisp
;;; continued from above
CL-USER> (funcall (adder 3) 5)
8
CL-USER> (apply (adder 3) '(5))
8
CL-USER> (defparameter *my-fun* (adder 3))
*MY-FUN*
* *my-fun*
#<Interpreted Function "LAMBDA (N)" {486468C9}>
CL-USER> (funcall *my-fun* 5)
8
CL-USER> (*my-fun* 5)
Warning: This function is undefined:
  *MY-FUN*
~~~

Note that in the last example the function object returned by `(adder 3)` is stored in the _value cell_ of `*my-fun*` - thus the error message. If we want to be able to use the symbol `*my-fun*` in the car of a compound form, we have to explicitly store something in its _function cell_ (which is normally done for us by the macro [`defun`](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defun.htm)):

~~~lisp
;;; continued from above
CL-USER> (fboundp '*my-fun*)
NIL
CL-USER> (setf (symbol-function '*my-fun*) (adder 3))
#<Interpreted Function "LAMBDA (N)" {4869FA19}>
CL-USER> (fboundp '*my-fun*)
T
CL-USER> (*my-fun* 5)
8
~~~

Now we are ready do define `doubler` as well:

~~~lisp
CL-USER> (defun doubler (f)
    (lambda (x) (funcall f x x)))
DOUBLER
CL-USER> (doubler #'+)
#<Interpreted Function "LAMBDA (F)" {48675791}>
CL-USER> (doubler '+)
#<Interpreted Function "LAMBDA (F)" {486761B1}>
CL-USER> (funcall (doubler #'+) 4)
8
CL-USER> (funcall (doubler '+) 4)
8
CL-USER> (defparameter *my-plus* '+)
*MY-PLUS*
CL-USER> (funcall (doubler *my-plus*) 4)
8
CL-USER> (defparameter *my-fun* (doubler '+))
*MY-FUN*
CL-USER> (funcall *my-fun* 4)
8
~~~

Note that the argument to `funcall` (and `apply`) can either be the function itself, i.e. `#'+`, or a symbol which has the function in its function cell (is fbound to the function), i.e. `'+`.


All of the above is _extremely simplified_ - we haven't even mentioned macros, special forms, symbol macros, self-evaluating objects, and lexical environments. Read the CLHS section about [form evaluation](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/03_aba.htm) for the real deal.

## Currying functions

### Concept

A related concept is that of _[currying](<a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scott/pl/lectures/caml-intro.html#higherorder)_ which you might be familiar with if you're coming from a functional language. After we've read the last section that's rather easy to implement:

~~~lisp
CL-USER> (declaim (ftype (function (function &rest t) function) curry) (inline curry))
NIL
CL-USER> (defun curry (function &rest args)
           (lambda (&rest more-args)
	           (apply function (append args more-args))))
CURRY
CL-USER> (funcall (curry #'+ 3) 5)
8
CL-USER> (funcall (curry #'+ 3) 6)
9
CL-USER> (setf (symbol-function 'power-of-ten) (curry #'expt 10))
#<Interpreted Function "LAMBDA (FUNCTION &REST ARGS)" {482DB969}>
CL-USER> (power-of-ten 3)
1000
~~~

Note that the [`declaim`](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_declai.htm) statement above is just a hint for the compiler so it can produce more efficient code if it so wishes. Leaving it out won't change the semantics of the function.

### With the Alexandria library

Now that you know how to do it, you may appreciate using the
implementation of the
[Alexandria](https://common-lisp.net/project/alexandria/draft/alexandria.html#Data-and-Control-Flow)
library (in Quicklisp).

~~~lisp
(ql:quickload :alexandria)

(defun adder (foo bar)
  "Add the two arguments."
  (+ foo bar))

(defvar add-one (alexandria:curry #'adder 1) "Add 1 to the argument.")

(funcall add-one 10)  ;; => 11

(setf (symbol-function 'add-one) add-one)
(add-one 10)  ;; => 11
~~~
