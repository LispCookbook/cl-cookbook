# Some notes on contribution

1. If filing a new article, please check the bug tracker and,
   if the issue is not already there, please file a bug before
   doing the work. There is likely to be discussion which could 
   help. Why waste your own time?
 
2. Please contribute in English (poor English is **OK**, the 
   maintainers can help and it'll **be improved!). Please verify 
   all Lisp code works, noting the specific Lisp implementation 
   you used to verify. Please verify all links work.
   
3. Please check the license. Your work may be edited, copied, and changed,
   and you should be OK with that! And, please do not copy and paste code you
   don't have the copyright to! 
   
4. Please don't be afraid to file a bug as the method of communication. It's 
   much easier to find for others when you do that.
