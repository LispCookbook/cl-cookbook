> Cookbook, n.
> a book containing recipes and other information about the preparation and cooking of food.

A Cookbook is an invaluable resource, as it shows how to do various things in a clear fashion without all the theoretical context. Sometimes you just need to look things up. While cookbooks can never replace proper documentation such as the HyperSpec or books such as Practical Common Lisp, every language deserves a good cookbook, Common Lisp included.

The CL Cookbook aims to tackle all sort of topics, for the beginner as for the more advanced developer.

# Further remarks

This is a collaborative project that aims to provide for Common Lisp something
similar to the [Perl Cookbook][perl] published by O'Reilly. More details about
what it is and what it isn't can be found in this [thread][thread] from
[comp.lang.lisp][cll].

If you want to contribute to the CL Cookbook, please send a pull request in or
file a ticket!

Yes, we're talking to you! We need contributors - write a chapter that's missing
and add it, find an open question and provide an answer, find bugs and report
them, (If you have no idea what might be missing but would like to help, take a
look at the [table of contents][toc] of the Perl Cookbook.) Don't worry about
the formatting, just send plain text if you like - we'll take care about that
later.

Thanks in advance for your help!

The pages here on Github are kept up to date. You can also download a
[up to date zip file][zip] for offline browsing. More info can be found at the
[Github project page][gh].
